This [Pelican][] plugin generates a site map in plain-text or XML format. You can use the `SITEMAP` variable in your settings file to configure the behavior of the plugin.

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-sitemap

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `sitemap` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

The `SITEMAP` setting must be a Python dictionary and can contain these keys:

* `format`, which sets the output format of the plugin (`xml` or `txt`)

* `priorities`, which is a dictionary with three keys:

    - `articles`, the priority for the URLs of the articles and their translations

    - `pages`, the priority for the URLs of the static pages

    - `indexes`, the priority for the URLs of the index pages, such as tags, author pages, categories indexes, archives, etc.

    All the values of this dictionary must be decimal floating-point numbers between `0` and `1`, such as `0.3` or `0.7`.

* `changefreqs`, which is a dictionary with three items:

    - `articles`, the update frequency of the articles

    - `pages`, the update frequency of the pages

    - `indexes`, the update frequency of the index pages

    Valid frequency values are `always`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` and `never`.

* `exclude`, which is a list of regular expressions that will be used to exclude matched URLs from the sitemap if *any* of them match. For example:

```python
SITEMAP = {
    "exclude": [
        "^/noindex/",  # starts with "/noindex/"
        "/tag/",       # contains "/tag/"
        "\.json$",     # ends with ".json"
    ]
}
```

If a key is missing or a value is incorrect, it will be replaced with the default value.

You can also exclude an individual URL by adding metadata to it, setting `private` to `True`.

The sitemap is saved in: `<output_path>/sitemap.<format>`

> **Note:** `priorities` and `changefreqs` are information for search engines and are only used in the XML site maps. For more information, see: <https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions>

**Example**

Here is an example configuration (it is also the default settings):

```python
SITEMAP = {
    "format": "xml",
    "priorities": {
        "articles": 0.5,
        "indexes": 0.5,
        "pages": 0.5
    },
    "changefreqs": {
        "articles": "monthly",
        "indexes": "daily",
        "pages": "monthly"
    }
}
```

Using Metadata
--------------

In addition to applying a configuration to all articles/pages using the `SITEMAP` setting, `ChangeFreq` and `Priority` can also be specified as metadata for individual articles/pages. The same restrictions on the values apply:

* Valid options for `ChangeFreq` are  `always`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` and `never`.
* Valid options for `Priority` must be a decimal number between `0` and `1`.

**Example**

Following is an example of using sitemap-related metadata in a Markdown file:

```
Title: Frequently Changed Article
ChangeFreq: daily
Priority: 0.3

This is the article content.
```
